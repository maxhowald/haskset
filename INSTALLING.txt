tested with ghc 7.8.3 and cabal 1.18. Should work fine on newer
versions, but some dependencies require new-ish versions of cabal.

note: You can install an older version of cabal from your distro
package manager, and then use cabal install cabal-install to install a
later version. But this will install in ~/.cabal/bin, so update your path
accordingly to make sure you're actually using the new version.

note: the versions of ghc and cabal in the offical ubuntu package
repos are pretty old. here's a ppa with the latest versions:
https://launchpad.net/~hvr/+archive/ubuntu/ghc


steps to build:

clone the repo, cd into it.

cabal sandbox init
cabal install --only-dependencies    #this will take a while... add -j4 to parallelize build
cabal configure && cabal build
cabal run
