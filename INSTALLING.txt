tested with ghc 7.8.3 and cabal 1.18. Should work
fine on newer versions, but newer versions break ghc-mod :(

note:cabal install cabal-install will install cabal in ~/.cabal/bin,
update your path accordingly if you actually want to be able to use
it.

note: the versions of ghc and cabal in the offical ubuntu package
repos are pretty old. here's a ppa with all the new versions:
https://launchpad.net/~hvr/+archive/ubuntu/ghc


steps to build:

clone the repo, cd into it.

cabal sandbox init
cabal install --only-dependencies    #this will take a while... add -j4 to parallelize build
cabal configure && cabal build
cabal run
