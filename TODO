GAVIN:

-make cards selectable/submittable: the user should click on a card to
 select it. when the user presses the set button, the cards are submitted 
(implement a javascript function which returns which cards are currently selected)

  -bonus: maximum of three cards are selectable. when the user clicks
   a fourth card, the first one they selected is automatically
   unselected

MAX:
-implement multiple games (simple)
-implement multiple players (a bit harder, requires learning how to use threads/concurrency in haskell)


???/JOINT:


-implement score: a javascript function which takes a SCORE string and
updates the scoreboard. (mostly gavin?)

-implement chat: a javascript function which takes a CHATS string and
updates the chat, as well as a textbox to submit new chats (mostly max? have example code already...)
