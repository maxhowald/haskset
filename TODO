GAVIN:

  -bonus: would be nice if a maximum of three cards are
   selectable. when the user clicks a fourth card, the first one they
   selected is automatically unselected

	 -display score, list of players, chat??? whatever there is room for, on screen...
   -what to show at the end of the game?
   - show a pile of cards, remaining?
	 -perhaps when a set is made, the person who got the set is highlighted.
or event queue, shownig... x made a set... etc.




MAX:

-implement more game rooms (simple but annoying)

-harden concurrency/stress test/debug multiplayer games

-what to do if someone leaves in the middle of a game? nothing, I suppose. but what if they come back?
-lock out new players after the game begins.

-test endgame/reset conditions... (ugh)


-display a summary of what's going on in the lobby... game in progress, num of players in each room, etc...
-drop chat in lobby?


(old)
???/JOINT: (lower priority)

-implement score: a javascript function which takes a SCORE string and
updates the scoreboard. (mostly gavin? score/rating still have to be
tracked on the backend)

-implement chat: a javascript function which takes a CHATS string and
updates the chat, as well as a textbox to submit new chats (mostly
max? have example code already...mostly handled by server...)
