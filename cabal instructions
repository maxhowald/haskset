setting up haskell

ok, the first thing you want to do is get the glasgow haskell compiler, ghc, and cabal, a package manager for haskell, from your distro's package manager.
e.g ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install ghc cabal

cabal --version

Now, this is fine, but a lot of times package managers have pretty old versions of cabal. But thats ok! we can get a new version of cabal with cabal itself. just do

cabal install cabal-install

this will install cabal in your $HOME/.cabal/bin directory.

cabal --version

no change! what?! 

you have to set your path. to include the above directory.


cabal --version
$HOME/.cabal/bin/cabal --version

STILL NO CHANGE???!?
the version installed by your package manager takes precedence. But we can just remove that now:

sudo apt-get remove cabal

cabal --version

yay!
